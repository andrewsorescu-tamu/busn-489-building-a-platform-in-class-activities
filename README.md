This repository contains any files related to projects I have worked on as part of my BUSN 489 (Developing a Platform) class at Texas A&M. I have worked on an app that allows the user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against another user or a machine, and an app which displays images of a dog or cat and uses a machine learning model to determine what type of dog or cat it is while displaying a confidence rating for its prediction. Finally, this repository contains files I worked on which helped me understand how to use Firebase to manage databases for xCode projects.
